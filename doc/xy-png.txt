NAME
  xy-png - write an XY image to a PNG file

SYNOPSIS
  xy-png [-h <height>] [-H] [-l <length>] [-s] [-V] [-w <width>] [-z]

DESCRIPTION
  XY images are described at https://husamalhomsi.net/xy-images.

  xy-png writes an XY image to a 1-bit grayscale, non-interlaced PNG file. The
  file has a name that encodes how it was produced. For example, a file named
  w256h256s.xy.png can be reproduced by an invocation equivalent to

    xy-png -w 256 -h 256 -s

OPTIONS
  -h <height>
    The positive integer <height> specifies the image's height in pixels.
    Defaults to 256. Must be less than or equal to 32768.

  -H
    Create a horizontal projection as if by moving black pixels up and white
    pixels down.

  -l <length>
    This additional option is equivalent to -w <length> -h <length>, which
    specifies a square image.

  -s
    Reveal stalactites by flood-filling the top row with a filler color,
    replacing black pixels with white, then replacing filler pixels with black.

  -V
    Create a vertical projection as if by moving black pixels to the left and
    white pixels to the right.

  -w <width>
    The positive integer <width> specifies the image's width in pixels.
    Defaults to 256. Must be less than or equal to 32768.

  -z
    Use the best compression level instead of the default. The compression is
    lossless, so expect the same image in more time and less size.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if an option is invalid;
  2 if an option argument is invalid;
  3 if creating libpng structs fails;
  4 if opening the file fails;
  5 if another libpng error occurs;
  6 if allocating memory fails;
  0 otherwise;
